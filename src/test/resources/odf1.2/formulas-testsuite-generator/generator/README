OpenFormula Test Suite
----------------------
Date: 25 Jul 1006

Description:
  This program takes the OpenFormula spec as an OpenDocument Text file
  and produces a suitable test suite as an OpenDocument Spreadsheet.

Copyright:
  Daniel Carrera 2006. This program is released under the GNU 
  General Public License. See the file COPYING for details.

Pre-requisites:
  * You must have xsltproc installed and it must be on your PATH.
  * You must have make (e.g. GNU make).
  * You must have a copy of the OpenFormula spec.
  * You must have perl on your PATH

Configuration:
  Edit the Makefile and edit the SPEC variable to point to the
  OpenFormula spec. You may optionally configure the path to the
  template and the name of the output file.

Usage:
  * make       => produces the test file cleanly.
  * make debug => produces the test file, keeping intermediate files.
  * make clean => removes intermediate files.

How it works:
  * step1.xsl
    1. Copy everything from the template.
    2. On the spec, search for tables with tests.
    3. Copy all of the test data. This does not include the last
       two columns: Actual result, Correct?
  * step2.xsl
    On a second pass, compute the last two columns.
