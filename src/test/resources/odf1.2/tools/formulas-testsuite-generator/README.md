# ODF FORMULAS TEST SUITE GENERATOR

## Overview

[Daniel Carrera](https://danielcarrera.space/) wrote a test suite generator for the ODF 1.2 formulas.
The idea was to have the tests being part of the specification and extract them in case of updates as an OpenDocument spreadsheet, which tests the formulas capacity of the ODF application opening the document.

The test suite generator was not used during ODF 1.3 and now kindly provided by Rob Weir.
The latest ODF formula specification annotated with notes is likely [OpenDocument-formula-20100119.odt](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/36002/OpenDocument-formula-20100119.odt) - locally available in [examples](./examples).
Similar the latest available generated example ODS test suite from 2006 - locally available in [examples](./examples).
